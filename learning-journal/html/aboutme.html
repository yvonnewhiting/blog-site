            <h4>Maintaining Commitment to Learning</h4>
                <p>
                    I consider myself a lifelong learner. In the past, I would dedicate countless hours to acquiring new knowledge and skills. I would then apply what I had learned by creating simple projects or incorporating new techniques into existing ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this approach was enjoyable, I realized that it could be beneficial to share my learning journey with the wider world.
                </p>
                <h4>Getting Started</h4>
                <p>
                I began this journey by starting small and gradually expanding my learning journal website. I diligently took notes during my learning sessions. After each session, I not only used these notes to reflect on what I had learned but also to write concise summaries in my own words.
                </p>
                <p>
                This practice not only deepened my understanding of the material but also had the unexpected benefit of helping others on their learning journeys, providing them with motivation and insights.
